In a quiet coastal town, a young inventor named Mira dreams of building a machine that can capture memories as living pictures.
One summer evening, Mira discovers an old lighthouse blueprint hidden in her grandmother's attic.
Inspired, she begins constructing a device that can turn stories into visual scenes powered by the lighthouse's rotating beacon.
As rumors spread, the townspeople bring their favorite tales to Mira, eager to see them light up the sea.
On the night of the annual lantern festival, a sudden storm threatens to cancel the celebration.
Mira races to finish her machine, hoping the images can guide ships and calm the frightened crowd.
With a final spark, the beacon ignites, projecting shimmering scenes across the waves and restoring hope to the town.
